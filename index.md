## Building Exhibits with Wax
This workshop will provide an introduction to the open source tool "Wax" which creates simple digital exhibits with a IIIF (international image interoperability framework) compliant image viewer. Using IIIF makes it possible for others to engage with digital objects more fully.

This workshop is part of the <a href="https://libcal.library.ubc.ca/calendar/vancouver/?t=g&q=Digital%20toolkit&cid=7544&cal=7544&inc=0">Digital Toolkit series</a> and is presented by the <a href="https://researchcommons.library.ubc.ca/">UBC Library Research Commons</a>.
